\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.05in}
We have presented a self-modulating nonparametric event-tensor factorization model. Our model can capture various triggering and inhibition effects among the interaction events, in both short and long ranges. Our inference is also efficient for large numbers of observed entries and events.
